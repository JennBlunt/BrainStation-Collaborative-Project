# BrainStation-Collaborative-Project
### Project 3, Collaborative Development

This project was a group assignment, with 3 of my class mates:
Kajen Kirubahkaran, Jake Maldonado, and Landon Ta.

We used a Jira Kanban to set up tickets for each task and to track progress, and Slack to communicate as a group. 

#### The major concepts that were new in this assignment were:
Jira/Kanban.
Git workflow with branches and features.

Each of us were responsible for front and back end tasks.

#### I was responsible for:
Initial set up of an Express server.
Set up an endpoint that serves details of a specific inventory item based on the ID parameter. 
UI and links for top & side bars.
UI and functionality to display the list of all warehouses.

This repo is the final product as I submitted it.
